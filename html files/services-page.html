        <div class="blockquote">
            <q>21st century schools and educators recognize that capturing,analyzing,and communicating 
                with data is critical to improving teaching,learning,and schooling.
            </q>

    <div class="content">
        <p>We offer a gamut of data analysis services that precisely cater to the client’s specific requirements. With extensive experience working with global clients and catering to their complex requirements, we are capable of processing any requests.</p>

        <p>Whether that is in education or not, at the Learning Analytics Collaborative (LAC), we strive to present the information in the simplest way to enable teachers and schools to take data-informed actions to ultimately benefit the learners.</p> 
        <p>            Visualizing student data to support learning has been our driving goal and we have been promoting best practices when it comes to data visualizations and creating cultures of data use at schools.
        </p>
        <p>            We need to go back to basics and start with Why? Why are you looking to visualize a certain dataset? What questions are you hoping to answer? Who will use this visualization, why, and when? Answering these basic questions will give us a good starting point and will also stop us from visualizing something that doesn’t need to be visualized in the first place and will guide us toward the best possible solution. 
        </p>
        <p>            Before we are able to use data and turn it into insight through Data Analytics, we need to understand what data is and how we categorize it. We also need to know the data type you are dealing with in order to either choose the right visualization method or be able to understand and consume the information being presented.
        </p>
        <p>            Communicating data through charts, graphs, infographics, maps, and other visual displays allows audiences to understand data more easily and can reveal conclusions that are difficult to see with numbers alone. </p>
